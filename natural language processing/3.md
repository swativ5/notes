# Introduction to Syntax, Semantics & Morphology

##### Levels of Linguistic Analysis:
- Morphology: The study of the structure and formation of words, including prefixes, suffixes, and root words.
    - tokenization, stemming, lemmatization
- Syntax: The study of the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences in a language.
    - POS (part-of-speech) tagging, parsing, dependency trees
- Semantics: The study of meaning in language, including the meanings of words, phrases, and sentences.
    - sentiment analysis, question answering

---
- Traditional NLP: Explicit rules for morphology, syntax, and semantics are defined by linguists and implemented in code.
- Modern NLP (BERT, GPT): Learn these patterns automatically from large datasets using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

Morphology: studies the internal structure of words, how words are built up from smaller meaningful units called morphemes.
- example: dogs = dog + s (where "s" indicates plural form), unladylike = un ("not") + lady ("well behaved women")+ like ("having the characteristic of")
- Morphemes can be classified into two types:
    - Free morphemes: can stand alone as words & often combine with other morphemes too (e.g., "book", "run").
    - Bound morphemes: cannot stand alone and must be attached to other morphemes (e.g., prefixes like "un-", suffixes like "-ed").

- Stems: the core part of a word to which affixes can be added (e.g., "play" in "playing", "played").

- Types of affixes:
    - Prefixes: added to the beginning of a word (e.g., "un-" in "unhappy").
    - Suffixes: added to the end of a word (e.g., "-ness" in "happiness").
    - Infixes: inserted within a word (less common in English, more common in other languages).

- Content and functional morphemes:
    - Content morphemes: carry semantic meaning (e.g., car, book, house, -able, un-)
    - Functional morphemes: serve grammatical purposes (e.g., A, the, he, -s (plural), -s (3rd singular)).

- Inflectional vs Derivational morphemes:
    - Inflectional morphemes: modify a word for grammar (tense, number, etc.) without changing its core meaning or part of speech (e.g., walk -> walked, cat -> cats).
    - Derivational morphemes: create new words by changing the meaning or part of speech (e.g., happy -> happiness, teach -> teacher, happy -> unhappy).

- Morphological Analysis:
    - cats -> cat +N + PL
    - cat -> cat +N + SG
    - identifying root + affixes and their grammatical features
    - approaches:
        - Rule based: handcrafted rules to identify morphemes
        - Lexicon based: dictionary of morphemes and their features, handles irregular forms
        - Statistical: probabilistic models to predict morpheme boundaries based on training data. uses algorithms like HMM, CRF
        - Neural: deep learning models to learn morphological patterns from large datasets. character level or subword models. LSTMs, Transformers, learns morphological features implicitly.
