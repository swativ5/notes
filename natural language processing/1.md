# Introduction to Natural Language Processing

NLU: Natural Language Understanding

NLG: Natural Language Generation

What is NLP?

- Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. The ultimate objective of NLP is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is valuable.

Language Model: Given a sequence of words, predict the next word in the sequence.

Why NLP is important?

- NLP is important because it helps bridge the gap between human communication and computer understanding. It enables machines to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data, making it possible to extract meaningful insights, automate tasks, and improve user experiences in various applications such as chatbots, virtual assistants, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.

Bias: Training data may contain biases that can lead to unfair or inaccurate outcomes in NLP applications.

Applications of NLP:
- Sentiment Analysis: Determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text, such as reviews or social media posts.
- Machine Translation: Automatically translating text from one language to another.
- Chatbots and Virtual Assistants: Enabling conversational agents to understand and respond to user queries.
- Search Engines: Improving search results by understanding user intent and context.
- Autocompletion and Spell Checking: Assisting users in writing by predicting words or correcting spelling errors
- Entity Recognition: Identifying and classifying entities (e.g., names, dates, locations) in text.
- Information Extraction in different domains: Extracting structured information from unstructured text.
- Text Summarization: Generating concise summaries of longer documents or articles.
    - Extractive Summarization: Selecting important sentences or phrases from the original text.
    - Abstractive Summarization: Generating new sentences that capture the essence of the original text.
- Spam Detection: Identifying and filtering out unwanted or malicious emails or messages.


Bag-of-Words Model:- A simple representation of text data where each document is represented as a bag (multiset) of its words, disregarding grammar and word order but keeping multiplicity.\

Stop Words:- Common words that are often filtered out in NLP tasks because they carry little meaningful information (e.g., "the", "is", "in", "and").

Term Frequency (TF):- A measure of how frequently a term appears in a document, often used in text mining and information retrieval.

Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):- A measure of how important a term is in a collection of documents, calculated as the logarithm of the total number of documents divided by the number of documents containing the term.

TF-IDF:- A statistical measure that combines Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents.

Word Embeddings:- A type of word representation that allows words to be represented as vectors in a continuous vector space, capturing semantic relationships between words (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).
