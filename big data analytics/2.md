# Introduction to MongoDB for Big Data Analytics

MongoDb is an open-source document oriented databse that provides high performance, high availability, and easy scalability. 

It is classified as a NoSQL database because it does not use the traditional table-based relational database structure. Instead, it uses a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON) to store data.

- represent data as collections of json documents
- uses object querying

Key features:
- high performance for read and write operations
- high availability with replica sets
- automatic scalinf
- aggregation
- indexing
- load balancing (sharding) (divide data across multiple servers to distribute the load)
- file storage (GridFS)
- easy readability

- data structre composed of field and value pairs
- mongodb documents are similar to json objects
- value of a field can be a variety of data types including arrays and sub-documents
- example for a document representing a person:
{
    name: "sue",                -> field:value
    age: 29,                    -> field:value
    status: "A",                -> field:value
    groups: ["news", "sports"]  -> field:value
}

Database -> Collection -> Document -> Field
- mongodb stores alld ocuments in collections
- a collection is a group of related documents similar to a table in relational databases
- collections are similar to a table in relational databases

Document Structure
{
    _id: ObjectId("507f1f77bcf86cd799439011"),  -> unique identifier for the document
    name: {first:"Alan", last: "Turing"},       -> field:value where value is a sub-document
    age: 30,                                    -> field:value
    birthdate: ISODate("1912-06-23T00:00:00Z"), -> field:value where value is a date

}


MongoDB Datatypes
- Number: 32-bit or 64-bit floating point
- Array: ordered list of values
- Object: embedded document
- Boolean: true or false
- Date: date and time
- ObjectId: unique identifier for documents


MongoDD CRUD Operations
- Create: db.collection.insertOne(), db.collection.insertMany()
- Read: db.collection.find(), db.collection.findOne()
- Update: db.collection.updateOne(), db.collection.updateMany(), db.collection.replaceOne()
- Delete: db.collection.deleteOne(), db.collection.deleteMany()
