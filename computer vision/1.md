# Metrics in Radiometry and Photometry
- Radiance
- Radiant flux
- Luminous flux
- Illuminance
- Luminance
- Reflectance
- Radiant Intensity: power per unit solid angle
- Luminous Intensity: visible power per unit solid angle
- Irradiance: power incident per unit area E = dΦ/dA
- Illuminance: visible power incident per unit area

#### A simple model of image formation

- radiance: light falling on a surface from a particular direction
- irradiance: total light falling on a surface from all directions

#### Photometric Image formatation
- after starting from one or more lught sources, light interacts with the scene surfaces and is eventually recorded by a camera
- the photons arriving at the camera sensor are converted into an electrical signal, which is then digitized (RGB values) to produce a digital image

- Camera irradiance -> Camera Body (Optics -> Aperture -> Shutter) -> Sensor Chip (Sensor (CCD/CMOS) -> Gain -> A /D Conversion) -> Digital Image (RAW) -> Image Processing (Demosaicing -> Sharpen -> White Balance -> Gamma/curve -> Compression) -> Final Image (JPEG)

- The first part of camera which interacts with the photons of light forom the environment is the optics (lens) of the camera
- Aperture: opening in the lens that controls the amount of light reaching the sensor
- Shutter: mechanism that opens and closes to control the duration of light exposure on the sensor

    Sensors:
    - CCD (Charge-Coupled Device) and CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) are two types of image sensors used in digital cameras
    - Both types of sensors convert incoming light (photons) into electrical signals (electrons)
    - CCD sensors transfer the charge across the chip and read it at one corner, while CMOS sensors have amplifiers at each pixel, allowing for faster readout and lower power consumption


- Gain: amplification of the electrical signal to improve sensitivity (low light conditions)
- Demosaicing: process of reconstructing a full-color image from the incomplete color samples output by the image sensor
- White Balance: adjustment of colors to make the image appear more natural under different lighting conditions
- Gamma/curve: non-linear operation used to encode and decode luminance or tristimulus values in images to account for human perception. Involves applying a power-law function to the pixel values to account for non-linear response of display devices and human vision
- Compression: reducing the file size of the image for storage and transmission, can be lossy (JPEG) or lossless (PNG)

### Photometric Image Formation Model
- 3D geometric feature in the owrld are projected onto a 2D image features in an image

#### Lighting
- images cant be formed without light
- to produce an image, the scene must be illuminated by one or more light sources
- light sources can be point sources (sun, light bulb) or area sources (windows, fluorescent lights)
- A point light source emits light uniformly in all directions from a single point in space
- An area light source emits light from a surface area, resulting in softer shadows and more diffuse illumination. They are used to light up large area with more even lighting.
- Other lights are volume lights, ambient lights, spot lights etc
- The intesity fo the light falls of with distance according to the inverse square law: I ∝ 1/d^2 (the same light spreads over a larger area as the distance increases, it may also have a directional faloff )

Reflectance and Shading
- the amount of light arriving and reflecting can be defined by various models/function:
- THe most general mosel is the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) which defines how light is reflected at an opaque surface
- other models-diffuse, specular, phong

- they can be used to compute the global corresponding ...

- Directions from light arriving at a surface point to the viewer and from the light source to the surface point matter

BRDF
- help find the relationship between incoming light and outgoing light at a surface point
